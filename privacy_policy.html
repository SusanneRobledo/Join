        <h5>Liability for Content</h5>

        <p>The contents of our website have been created with the greatest possible care. However, we cannot guarantee
            the
            contents' accuracy, completeness, or topicality. According to Section 7, paragraph 1 of the TMG
            (Telemediengesetz - German Telemedia Act), we as service providers are liable for our content on these pages
            by
            general laws. However, according to Sections 8 to 10 of the TMG, we service providers are not obliged to
            monitor
            external information transmitted or stored or investigate circumstances pointing to illegal activity.
            Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected. However, a
            liability
            in this regard is only possible from the moment of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon notification
            of
            such violations, we will remove the content immediately.</p>

        <h5>Liability for Links</h5>

        <p>Our website contains links to external websites, over whose contents we have no control. Therefore, we cannot
            accept any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the websites is
            always
            responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
            violations at
            the time of linking. Illegal contents were not identified at the time of linking. However, permanent
            monitoring
            of the contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without specific indications of a violation. Upon
            notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.</p>

        <h5>Copyright</h5>

        <p>The contents and works on these pages created by the site operator are subject to German copyright law. The
            duplication, processing, distribution, and any kind of utilization outside the limits of copyright require
            the
            written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of these pages are only permitted
            for
            private, non-commercial use. In so far as the contents on this site were not created by the operator, the
            copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you
            become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. Upon notification of violations, we
            will
            remove such contents immediately.</p>
